# MemorandaUpdater
Help contribute to the Memoranda Updater

Hello there, this is Team Erlang reporting and we need your help 
with creating an updater for the Memoranda App. The app itself is
in a jar file so we should be able to make use of the jar uf 
functionality. Unfortunately, our team is not the most well versed
in scripting languages, so that is where you come in. If this 
sounds like the something you would like to help with, feel free
to clone and create pull requests to help us out!!!

The jar file is included in the repo to test with.

Thank You, 

Team Erlang
